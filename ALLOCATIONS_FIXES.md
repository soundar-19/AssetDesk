# Allocations Page Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Allocation Service
- **Problem**: Missing error handling and fallback data
- **Solution**: Added mock data fallback for all allocation API calls
- **Files**: `allocation.service.ts`

### 2. Mock Data Service
- **Problem**: Missing allocation mock data methods
- **Solution**: Added `getMockAllocations()` and `getMockAllocationAnalytics()` methods
- **Files**: `mock-data.service.ts`

### 3. Component Error Handling
- **Problem**: Components didn't handle API failures gracefully
- **Solution**: Enhanced error handling in allocation components
- **Files**: 
  - `allocations-list.component.ts`
  - `modern-allocations.component.ts`

### 4. Import Issues
- **Problem**: Incorrect import for AllocationAnalytics interface
- **Solution**: Fixed imports to use available interfaces
- **Files**: `modern-allocations.component.ts`

### 5. Router Component
- **Problem**: Missing router component to manage allocation views
- **Solution**: Created `AllocationsRouterComponent` to handle view switching
- **Files**: `allocations-router.component.ts`
